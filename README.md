# Boggle Game

Welcome to the Boggle Game! This project implements a Boggle game where players can find words on a 4x4 grid of letters. The game comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.

## Features

- **Interactive GUI:** The game features a graphical user interface that allows players to interact with the Boggle board and find words.

- **Real-time Updates:** As you explore the Boggle board and find words, the GUI is updated in real-time to reflect your progress.

- **Word Tracking:** The game keeps track of found words, updates your score, and provides feedback on the validity of the words you discover.

- **Game Reset:** You can reset the game at any time to start a new round.

## How to Play
